<h1>ShopEase Retail Store Cloud Migration: Implementation Guide</h1>

This document will walk you through how to implement the data migration project for ShopEase Retail Store. Before you can proceed,, you should create an Azure account, provide necessary information, and create at least one subscription. Usually, when you are new on Azure, you get a $200 credit to try out the services. 

<h3>Business Introduction</h3>

ShopEase Retail is a mid-sized retail chain specializing in consumer goods, electronics, and household products, with over 50 stores across multiple regions in the United Kingdom. Known for its customer-centric approach, ShopEase combines both in-store and online shopping experiences to deliver high-quality products at competitive prices.

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

ShopEase Retail currently relies on an aging on-premise database infrastructure to store and manage critical business data, including sales, inventory, and customer information. Maintaining this infrastructure requires significant costs and resources, including hardware upgrades, manual backups, and ongoing server maintenance. In addition to these operational challenges, the system experiences occasional outages, particularly during high traffic periods, which disrupt the online shopping experience for customers. These outages result in lost sales and diminished customer satisfaction.

<h3>Proposed Solution</h3>

To remain competitive and enhance business operations, ShopEase must migrate to a more scalable, cost-effective, and reliable cloud-based data infrastructure. This migration will not only reduce the burden of maintaining on-premise resources but also improve data accessibility, enabling advanced analytics to drive business insights and improve the customer experience.

<h3>Rationale for the Project</h3>
- Cost Reduction
- Improved Reliability and Uptime
- Scalability
- Faster Data Access and Analytics
- Improved Customer Experience
- Enhanced Data Security and Compliance
